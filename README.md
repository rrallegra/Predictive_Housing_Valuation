# Predictive_Housing_Valuation

Title: Beachfront Bungalows
(House Price Valuation in US and Australia Using Machine Learning)
 
Author:  Raj Ray


Project Description:

The objective of this machine learning project is to determine which model is best suited for house price valuation based on multiple parameters. As a part of this process, various insights will be generated based on the performance of different models.  
Scope of Research:

This research is limited to:
•	Predictive Analysis
•	Supervised machine learning models 
(e.g., Assumption:  datasets with known outcome (labels) are already available) 

Models (Algorithms):
•	Linear Regression 
•	Multiparameter Regression with Gradient Descent Boosting
•	Decision trees
•	Random Forests
•	Support Vector Machines (SVM)
•	K-nn Model
•	K-fold Grid-Search with Cross Validation 
(Note: One-Hot Encoding would be used to transform any categorical parameters into numeric values)

Performance Metrics: 
•	Mean Absolute Error
•	Accuracy
•	Correlations

Potential Research Questions:

1.	What are the key parameters that affect house price valuation?
2.	What are the main challenges of machine learning?
3.	How to improve accuracy and reduce the effects of overfitting?
4.	Does overall performance depend on feature selection?
5.	What are the effects of cross-validation?
6.	Did certain algorithms perform poorly on both datasets?  Why?
7.	Is it possible to do any predictive analysis based on these patterns? (linear regression/line fit)
8.	Is the real-estate market in US or Australia currently overvalued or oversold based on our historical data?

Core Phases:

1.	Exploratory Analysis – Framing the Problem 
2.	Data Input 
3.	Selection of Features and Labels
4.	Data Visualization
5.	Data Preparation / Cleaning
6.	Model Creation / Algorithm Selection
7.	Training and Testing
8.	Model Fine-Tuning and Reporting Final Results.

Datasets:
